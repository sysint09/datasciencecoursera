==================================================================

For each record it is provided the mean and standard deviation AVERAGE for each activity and each subject of these variable:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 

Therefor the data set has got:
activity: label of activity
subject: identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment
